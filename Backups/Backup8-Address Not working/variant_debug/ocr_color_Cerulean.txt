kk kkk Surfs up dudes,and lassie’s\{It is another great time in Florida,and this water bottle is most excellent!

Patrick {The Nalgene 32 oz. Water bottle is groovy!l just gotta take it out of the freezer!}

kk kkk I'm a forest engineer and spend almost every day pioneering rugged mountain terrain. Almost 2

Samuel years of using this bottle on every adventure it finally broke after being dropped for the millionth

Muraski time
| know it’s weird to find a 5-star review about a product breaking, but this water bottle has been my
trusty companion on every occasion and it's durability was pushed far beyond any reasonable
expectations. | would recommend it to anyone. I'm gonna try an ultra lite this time around. I have a
few other bottle made of the ultra lite material and their flexibility may be better equipped for my
abuse.

kkk Love mine, had it for almost 20 years. Please make a 48 oz narrow mouth for hiking!

| have had the dark red 320z with black cap since 2002. Itis all original and has survived the freezer
3 times. | estimate | have had close to 1000 gallons of water thru it. Id say it’s a great product

kk kkk Love the wide mouth 32oz bottles. | have several. Just bought the narrow mouth bottle. Same great
Jason Gaze water bottle but easier to drink from? Gotta have it! They're the only water bottles for me.
kkk Great color, wonderful in person, my favorite colorway definitely

Moises

kk kkk Amazing, the best water bottle I've used. | have three of theses

Tyler Conway

| purchased this for my little brother because he goes through so many disposable water bottles
He likes the similarity of drinking out of the narrow mouth compared to a disposable water bottle
and it dramatically reduces the amount of disposable water bottles used in the household.

He uses it every day and brings it with him everywhere, so it was an awesome investment!

| highly recommend the narrow mouth for any disposable water bottle chuggers out there!

eodore h No doubt Nalgene has some great bottles. We highlighted them as one of the best bottles in 2015
