We built the Nano Puff” Jacket for climbers who needed a
weather-resistant, lightweight and packable synthetic
insulation layer that could stay warm even when wet and
withstand seasons of use. Ever since, those same features
have made it the uncontested favorite midlayer for just
about any outdoor pursuit. With fit refinements for
improved mobility, 60-g PrimaLoft” Gold Insulation Eco
100% postconsumer recycled polyester with PURE.
(Produced Using Reduced Emissions) technology, anda
100% recycled polyester shell and lining, this iteration of
the Nano Puff reinforces why so many people call this the
“magic jacket.” Made in a Fair Trade Certified” factory.
