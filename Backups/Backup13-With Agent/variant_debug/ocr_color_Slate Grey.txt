Why we made this?

You asked for it, we delivered. The next evolution in our
lineup of Back Support shirts combines the technology
from our Shoulder Support Shirts with our Lower Back
Support Shirts, creating the ultimate muscle-
supporting, pain-fighting compression shirt.

When to wear?

Wear it under work shirts or workout clothes. On-the-
go or on the couch. If you have back pain, you're not
going to want to take this thing off.

What to expect?
Feel the stress and tension melt away from the second
you zip in.

Description

We designed the ultimate compression shirt for people
with back pain. The Men’s Full Back Support Short
Sleeve Shirt combines the Posture Support panels of
our Shoulder Support Shirt with the Power Mesh panels
of our Lower Back Support Shirt—helping to ease
muscle tension and promote healthy posture from
shoulders to hips. Made with our proprietary 4D stretch
compression fabric, this sleek and comfortable base
layer soothes everyday aches and pains while wicking

sweat and breathing well under outer layers. If you
know back pain, you know exactly why this shirt is such
a big deal.

Our Copper Znergy® fabric technology provides
permanent anti-odor benefits by preventing the growth
of odor-causing microbes. It’s 100% infused into all of
‘our garments and won't wash out.
