We built the Nano Puff” Jacket for climbers who needed a
weather-resistant, lightweight and packable synthetic
insulation layer that could stay warm even when wet and
withstand seasons of use. Ever since, those same features
have made it the uncontested favorite midlayer for just
about any outdoor pursuit. With fit refinements for
improved mobility, 60-g PrimaLoft” Gold Insulation Eco
100% postconsumer recycled polyester with PURE.
(Produced Using Reduced Emissions) technology, anda
100% recycled polyester shell and lining, this iteration of
the Nano Puff reinforces why so many people call this the
“magic jacket.” Made in a Fair Trade Certified” factory.

Jacket
Found this jacket at Back Country for far less shipping. Charge through Patagonia for shipping is outrageous. Would shop this site if they were to rethink
how much they charge to ship. The jacket is great. Purchased for my son asa birthday gift. Unfortunately could not purchase it here

Not a looser fit?

Based on a review saying looser fit, ordered Med to replace my 3 yr old L. Bad idea. Jacket way too tight by maybe 3”. returned and ordered L. Will need to
have altered to fit. Bummed. Sizes between different products not consistent - have both Large and Medium Patagonia jackets and sweaters.

Good quality but strange fit

Have tried these jackets numerous times but fit is strange in arms (Mis long and | am 6’1” with 33-34 sleeve) and body. Maybe just me.

Solid all around jacket
The nano puff jacketis a really great all around light jacket. The fit is more trim than the regular fit of the down sweater, so if you're between sizes, size up
for a loose fit, or size down for a slim fit. I've enjoyed wearing it casually, and | look forward to cold weather climbing in it.
